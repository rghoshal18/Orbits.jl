# Orbit.jl

This is a package which can be used for doing basic simulation of orbital parameters. It was a part of
my summer project in year 2019.

## Getting Started

Before starting to use this tool, you need to have some knowledge of:

```
Keplerian Elements
Coordinate Systems like GCRS, ITRF etc.
Julian Date
IERS Convention
j2 effect of earth
and basic coordinate geometry concepts.
```

### Prerequisites

You need to install the software and how to install them

```
julia (minimum 1.1.1)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
